Rabbit Apocalypse!
==================

This repository contains the source code for the little free XNA game "Rabbit Apocalypse!".

You can download an installer for the game here: http://www.valryon.fr/telechargements/?did=11

The game was created in 3 months using XNA and Ogmo Editor http://www.ogmoeditor.com/ (in an old version) by Damien Mayance (Valryon), Thibault Person (Lapinou) and Gabriel Corbel (yaki_).
So you will need:
- XNA 4.0
- Ogmo Editor in its last Adobe Air version (I think it has been lost forever)
- to install the font Resources/Fonts/stan0765.ttf to your fonts.

Feel free to contact me for further information.
